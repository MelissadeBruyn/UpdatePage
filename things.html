                    Most of this is just filler BS but whatever. So things I did...
                    Uh I went to school and continued daily activities.
                    Nothing much happened. I just want to pass this class 
                    so don't judge my mediocre website too harshly.
                    Here is a random aesthetic image of a book because I don't read.
                    All I did since last time being in this class was homework and youtube?
                    I ruined a sketchbook I guess. Lorem Ipsum Yay.
                    Thanks for reading my ted talk.
